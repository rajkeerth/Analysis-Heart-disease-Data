The task here is to predict the quality of red wine on a scale of 0â€“10 given a set of features as inputs. I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression.

WineQualityPrediction
Given a set of features as inputs, the task here is to predict the quality of wine on a scale of 0 - 10. I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression.


Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data): quality (score between 0 and 10)

Dependencies
Python
Pandas
matplotlib
numpy
scikit-learn
Setup
Clone the repository
The repo contains the IPython Notebook for prediction task and the dataset as csv file.
